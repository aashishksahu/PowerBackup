# PowerBackup
Powershell + GPG backup utility

Simple shell script to backup the contents of a directory. Simply drop your files in the "[backup name]_IN" folder, run the script and get your gpg encrypted files in the "[backup name]_OUT" folder.

If these directories don't exist, just run the script at your desired location and they will be created.
